Petal is a modern, light CSS UI framework developed at [Shakr](http://shakr.com).

Petal aims to provide an ample set of consistently designed UI components you can easily utilize in your web projects.

Petal is fully coded on LESS from scratch.


## Setting up Petal in your project
Please refer to the [documentation](http://shakrmedia.github.io/petal/) for detailed ways to use Petal to your project.


## Developing Petal
Petal uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for compiling LESS files to a single `petal.css` and also building the documentation pages with 
[Assemble](http://assemble.io/). Default task `grunt` will compile the CSS file and documentation for a single time. Run `grunt dev` to go into development mode where files in the Petal directory will be watched when you save any of the source files, which is handy when you will be actively making changes to the code!

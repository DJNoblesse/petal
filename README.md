Petal is a new, clean and modern CSS UI framework developed at [Shakr](http://shakr.com). 

Petal aims to provide a rich set of consistently designed UI components you can easily use in your web projects, while keeping everything lighter and simple.

While it's similar to Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and shares some naming conventions and structures, it's completely independent and is coded from scratch on LESS.

## NOTE: WIP
Petal is a work-in-progree project since January 2015. Core modules code and documentation are incomplete. Delete this notice when it's ready for public release.


## Get Started
Include the `link` code inside the `<head>` of your HTML file.
```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://shakr-petal.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/edge/petal.min.css">
```

Refer to the documentation page on how to use the available components and style classes.

Petal
=====

Petal is a new, clean and modern CSS UI framework developed at Shakr. Petal aims to provide a rich set of consistently designed UI components you can easily use in your web projects, while keeping everything lighter and simple.

While it's similar to Twitter's ![Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) and shares some naming conventions and structures, it's completely independent and is coded from scratch on LESS.


## Get Started
Include the `link` code inside the `<head>` of your HTML file.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://shakr-petal.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/edge/petal.min.css">
```

Refer to the documentation page on how to use the available components and style classes.
